# This fork #

This purpose of this fork is simply to make it easier and predictable to clone from for use within another project. This base branch
make's just a single simple change to src/image.c in order to make it easier to use within some python projects. In addition at this
stage the intention is to use the state of the code as last worked on by PJ Reddie.
